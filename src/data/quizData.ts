// The love poem
export const lovePoem = `You pick a piece of me
I pick a piece of you
Piece by piece
We both started to fit

With scars that bled
Stories that hurt
And memories that burned
We still longed for growth

You are fire
I am water
A natural disaster
Waiting to occur

If you were the storm
Then I was the thunder that clapped for you
You would burn the world with your rage
But I'll gladly cheer you on

Strangers so different
Souls so similar
Blossoming
Against all odds`;
